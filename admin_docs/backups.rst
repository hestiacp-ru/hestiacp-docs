What is the difference between zstd and gzip
************************************************

ZSTD have been developed by Facebook as a replacement. During testing we a significant speed increase and lower disk space usage against gzip. 

For more information see https://github.com/facebook/zstd

************************************************
What is the optimal compression ratio
************************************************

Higher the number how better the compression ratio. During the testing we discoverd that "ZSTD" level 3 compares agains level 9 for disk space how ever much faster. ZSTD level 11 took the same time but an smaller small size. Level higher then 19 should never be used as zstd becomes terrible slow.

How to change default backup folder
***************************************************************

Due to security reasons, symlinks are not allowed. To change the default backup folder, you can do the following:

1. Make sure backup folder to set to /backup/
2. If it ever had something in it, delete and recreate it, using your FTP client or by typing "mkdir backup" in console. 
3. Mount desired folder to backup, using mount:

.. code-block:: bash

    mount --bind /path/to/new/backup/folder /backup
    
For a permanent fix  you should add a record to fstab, so this folder would load on your system boot:

1. Open /etc/fstab
2. Add the following line to the end:

.. code-block:: bash

    /path/to/new/backup/folder /backup none defaults,bind 0 0
    
3. Save the file.
