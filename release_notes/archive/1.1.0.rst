  and additional php version can be enabled from the web interface.
  (/edit/server/ 'Web Server' section)


- Apache + (old)multiphp, Nginx + (old)multiphp, Nginx + Apache + (old)multiphp
  
  During the upgrade the following script will detect the php version used for
  each web domain and set the backend template accordingly

  mount --bind /backup /mnt/large-partition
