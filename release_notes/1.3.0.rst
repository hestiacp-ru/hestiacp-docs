Release notes for HestiaCP v1.3.0
*********************************

Release date: Oct 27 2020

Features
########

- Users can now choose to point a domain to a different document root location (similar to domain parking).
- The software update process will now perform a system health check before proceeding with installation.
- Administrators now have control over software update notifications through the following settings in `$HESTIA/conf/hestia.conf` and through the Control Panel web interface:
    - `UPGRADE_SEND_EMAIL` = Sends an email notification to primary admin account's email address
    - `UPGRADE_SEND_EMAIL_LOG` = Sends installation log output to the primary admin account's email address
- The upgrade process will now save installation logs to the `/root/hst_backups` directory by default for post-install troubleshooting.
    - **Note:** We may adjust this path in the future and will document such changes as they happen.
- We've introduced the ability to assign Administrator rights to other user accounts, enabling them to perform tasks under the Server Settings tab.
- We've introduced a more robust translation system which will allow us to provide higher quality translations in future releases.
    - **Note:** Some country codes have been updated, as a result your language setting may default back to English after upgrading.
- For new installations, MariaDB 10.5 is now the default version.
    - For existing installations, we've provided a manual post-install upgrade script. Please run `$HESTIA/install/upgrade/manual/upgrade_mariadb.sh` to migrate to MariaDB 10.5).
- The user interface theme has been set to "Dark" by default. This can be changed from **Server Settings > Configure > Basic Options > Appearance**.
    - **Note:** The name of the default theme has not been adjusted, and the change to the "dark" theme only applies to new installations at this time. This behavior may be changed in a future release.
